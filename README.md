# nasa_harvest_challenge


## Background 

(via https://zindi.africa/competitions/nasa-harvest-field-boundary-detection-challenge)

Small farms (<2ha) produce about 35% of the worldâ€™s food, and are mostly found in low- and middle-income countries. Mapping these farms allows policy-makers to allocate resources and monitor the impacts of extreme events on food production and food security. Unfortunately, these field-level maps remain mostly unavailable in low and middle income countries, where the food insecurity risk is highest. Combining machine learning with Earth Observation data from satellites like the PlanetScope constellation can help improve agricultural monitoring, cropland mapping, and disaster risk management for these small farms.


## Method & Results

Please see the linked notebook, where I annotate my methodology ( + sources) and demo the results that currently have me around 18th on the public leaderboard. I'll try to update this number as the competition closes, along with add my second notebook, where I use an ensemble of models to push my score a bit higher. 


Feel free to reach out if you have any questions / suggestions :-)
