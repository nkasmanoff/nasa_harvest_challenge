## Background 

(via https://zindi.africa/competitions/nasa-harvest-field-boundary-detection-challenge)

Small farms (<2ha) produce about 35% of the worldâ€™s food, and are mostly found in low- and middle-income countries. Mapping these farms allows policy-makers to allocate resources and monitor the impacts of extreme events on food production and food security. Unfortunately, these field-level maps remain mostly unavailable in low and middle income countries, where the food insecurity risk is highest. Combining machine learning with Earth Observation data from satellites like the PlanetScope constellation can help improve agricultural monitoring, cropland mapping, and disaster risk management for these small farms.
